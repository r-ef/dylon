## Introduction

The **FullStack Template: Vite + Flask** is a starter template for building web applications using **Vite** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend. It supports user authentication using **GitHub OAuth** and session management. Vite and Tailwind CSS are used to build responsive user interfaces.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using their GitHub accounts. OAuth tokens are managed securely.
- **OAuth-Based Session Management**: OAuth tokens are generated during login and stored securely.
- **Frontend**: Built with **Vite**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Backend**: The backend is built with **Flask** and connects to a **MongoDB** database through **PyMongo**. It defines several API routes for user actions like signing up and logging in.
