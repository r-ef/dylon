## Introduction

The **FullStack Template: Vue.js + Express.js** is a starter template for building web applications using **Vue.js** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. It supports user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), session management. Vue.js and Tailwind.css is used to build responsive user interfaces. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. Passwords are hashed using **bcryptjs**, and **JWT** is used for session management.
- **JWT-Based Session Management**: JWT tokens are generated during login and stored in **HTTP-only cookies**. 
- **Frontend**: Built with **Vue.js**, **Pinia** for state management, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. 
- **Backend**: The backend is built with **Express.js** and connects to a **MongoDB** database through **Mongoose**. It defines several API routes for user actions like signing up, logging in, and logging out.


## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Vue.js**: Framework for building the frontend UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-based CSS framework for styling and responsive design.
- **Vue Router**: Handles page navigation and routing.
- **Pinia**: Manages application state.
- **Vue Toastification**: Displays toast notifications.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment used to run the backend JavaScript code.
- **Express.js**: Handles the API requests and routing for the backend.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: used to model data and interact with MongoDB from the backend.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: Used to create and verify JWTs for user authentication.
