## Introduction
The **Flask + SQLite Authentication System** is a simple yet effective authentication solution built using Flask and SQLite. This template is designed to facilitate user registration, login, and session management, making it suitable for small projects or as a foundation for more complex systems.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register with a unique username and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users with their username and password.
- **Dashboard**: Displays a personalized dashboard after successful login.
- **Session Management**: Utilizes Flask sessions to manage user login states.
- **User Logout**: Allows users to log out and clear their session.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Adds SQLAlchemy support to Flask applications for interacting with the SQLite database.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process.

## Installation Steps
To set up the Flask + SQLite Authentication System with dylon, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ./venv/Scripts/activate  # Use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
4. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the login page.

## Routes and Functionalities

### User Registration
- **`/register` [GET, POST]**:
  - **GET**: Renders the registration page where new users can sign up.
  - **POST**: Handles form submissions for user registration. If the username is already taken, it flashes an error message; otherwise, it creates a new user and redirects to the login page with a success message.

### User Login
- **`/login` [GET, POST]**:
  - **GET**: Renders the login page where users can log in with their credentials.
  - **POST**: Handles login form submissions. If credentials are correct, it logs the user in by storing their user ID in the session and redirects to the dashboard; if incorrect, it flashes an error message.

### Dashboard Access
- **`/dashboard` [GET]**:
  - Displays the dashboard page if the user is logged in; otherwise redirects to the login page.

### User Logout
- **`/logout` [GET]**:
  - Logs the user out by clearing their session and redirects them to the homepage.

### Homepage
- **`/` [GET]**:
  - Renders the main homepage of the application.

## Flash Messages
The application uses flash messages to communicate various events to users:

- **Registration Success**: "Registration successful. Please log in."
- **Registration Error**: "Username already exists. Please choose a different one."
- **Login Error**: "Invalid username or password. Please try again."

## Database Structure
The application uses SQLite for storing user information. The database file is named `database.db` and is automatically created when the application is first run. The `User` model contains the following fields:

| Field       | Type      | Description                          |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| id          | Integer   | Primary key                          |
| username    | String    | Unique, cannot be null               |
| password    | String    | Cannot be null                       |
