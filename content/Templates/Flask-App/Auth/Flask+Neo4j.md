## Introduction
The **Flask + Neo4j Authentication System** is a simple yet effective authentication solution built using Flask and Neo4j. This template is designed to facilitate user registration, login, and session management, making it suitable for small projects or as a foundation for more complex systems.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register with a unique username and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users with their username and password.
- **Dashboard**: Displays a personalized dashboard after successful login.
- **Session Management**: Utilizes Flask sessions to manage user login states.
- **User Logout**: Allows users to log out and clear their session.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Neo4j**: A graph database management system that provides efficient and flexible handling of graph data.
- **python-dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Installation Steps
To set up the Flask + Neo4j Authentication System with Dylon, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ./venv/Scripts/activate  # Use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up the environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```bash
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
   NEO4J_USER=yourusername
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the login page.

   ## Routes and Functionalities

   ### User Registration
   - **`/register` [GET, POST]**:
     - **GET**: Renders the registration page where new users can sign up.
     - **POST**: Handles form submissions for user registration. If the username is already taken, it flashes an error message; otherwise, it creates a new user in Neo4j and redirects to the login page with a success message.
   
   ### User Login
   - **`/login` [GET, POST]**:
     - **GET**: Displays the login page where users can log in with their credentials.
     - **POST**: Handles login form submissions. If credentials are correct, it logs the user in by storing their username in the session and redirects to the dashboard; if incorrect, it flashes an error message.
   
   ### Dashboard Access
   - **`/dashboard` [GET]**:
     - Displays the dashboard page if the user is logged in; otherwise redirects to the login page.
   
   ### User Logout
   - **`/logout` [GET]**:
     - Logs the user out by clearing their session and redirects them to the homepage.
   
   ### Homepage
   - **`/` [GET]**:
     - Renders the main homepage of the application.

## Flash Messages
The application uses flash messages to communicate various events to users:

- **Registration Success**: "Registration successful. Please log in."
- **Registration Error**: "Username already exists. Please choose a different one."
- **Login Error**: "Invalid username or password. Please try again."

## Database Structure
The application uses Neo4j for storing user information. Neo4j is a graph database that stores data in nodes and relationships. In this application:

- **User Nodes**: Represented by `User` nodes in Neo4j.
- **Constraints**: A uniqueness constraint is created on the `username` property to ensure unique usernames.
