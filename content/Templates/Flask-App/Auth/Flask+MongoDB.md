- **MongoDB**: A flexible NoSQL database known for its scalability.

## Installation Steps
To set up the Flask + MongoDB Authentication System with serenity, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ./venv/Scripts/activate  # Use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Ensure MongoDB is running**:
   Confirm that your MongoDB server is operational locally or accessible remotely
   ```bash
   # Start Mongo Compass and connect to the local database if on Windows

   # Start MongoDB -- MacOS/Linux
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   # Check MongoDB Status
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```
4. **Set up the environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/test
   ```
5. **Run the Flask application**:
   Start the Flask server with:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
6. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the login page.
